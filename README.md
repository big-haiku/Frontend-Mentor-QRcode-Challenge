## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (mobile-only workflow to be fair, the design images didn't require a desktop layout)
- style-guide.md - For styles

### What I learned

While I feel I have the fundamentals of CSS/HTML down, this challenge helped me to reinforce them, and refine my more simple processes. Notably, not using a div for everything and instead varying my elements for easier readability.

I'm feeling good about my CSS starting setup, and feel like I'm developing a good basis for how I start future projects.

```css
:root {
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  color: var(--Dark-blue);
  background-color: var(--Light-gray);
}
```

### Continued development

While this project didn't demand it, keeping in mind opportunities to push responsive design going forward would represent a big advancement from this challenge.
